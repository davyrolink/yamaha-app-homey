# Yamaha receiver app for Athom Homey
Control your Yamaha network-enabled receiver using the Homey by Athom B.V.

Replaced Mute/Unmute for Cursor Down and Server Select and added USB Select

Important!
Before you can use it to turn your receiver on, you should go to the settings on your receiver's webpage (enter the IP adres in a browser), and go to settings -> Network Standby -> Select 'On'.
If you do not find these settings, take a look at this site, which might help you: http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/182663

You need to have the (local) IP-address of your receiver to add the device to Homey (There is no discovery)

Use at your own risk, I accept no responsibility for any damages caused by using this script.

#Changelog
Version 0.2.0

Big rewrite of the app.
YOU MUST REMOVE THE RECEIVER FROM THE HOMEY DEVICES AND RE-ADD IT!

Added functionality:
* Mobile cards to turn on/off, change volume, change source
* Support of the global tags for onoff, volume level, mute status, source status, surround status
* Support for multiple zones of the receiver (Main_Zone, Zone_2, etc)
* More source possibilities (f.e. HDMI6-8)

Version 0.1.1

Update capabilities crash v0.9.x

Version 0.1.0

Currently working:
* Turning receiver on/off
* Replaced Mute/Unmute for Cursor Down and Select
* Increase/decrease volume
* Set volume to a certain value
* Change source of receiver
* Change music equaliser settings of receiver

Turning receiver on this way takes 10-20 seconds, take care of this when using in a flow with something else (i.e., delay a command to change the receiver input if you want 1 flow to both turn the receiver on and change the input).

Fixed settings being destroyed upon restart
Added nice green check-mark in flows
